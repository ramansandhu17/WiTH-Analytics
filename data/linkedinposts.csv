"🌟 Happy 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗪𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻’𝘀 𝗗𝗮𝘆! 🌟

Today, 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 8th, not only do we celebrate International Women’s Day, but we also are reminded its 𝗪𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻’𝘀 𝗛𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵 - a time to reflect on the incredible achievements of women past, present, and future, and to #celebrate women’s contributions to history, culture, and society. 

We are proud to stand with women who continue to 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗯𝗮𝗿𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗿𝘀, 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗺𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆. As we reflect on how far we’ve come, we are also focused on the important work ahead: 𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵

💼Our 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 Committee is committed to providing resources and learning opportunities that help women grow their careers, hone their skills, and reach their full potential. 

🌝Through 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, we aim to share stories, highlight achievements, and amplify the voices of women in tech. By showcasing the success of our members, we create inspiration for young women who may not yet see themselves in this space.  

🌱Our 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 Committee works tirelessly to foster connections and build a supportive network where women can collaborate, support one another, and elevate each other’s success. 

💻And importantly, our 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 Program plays a pivotal role in shaping the leaders of tomorrow. Through mentoring, we’re giving back by passing on knowledge, offering guidance, and creating opportunities for women to thrive in the tech industry.  

Today, let’s not only celebrate the amazing women who have shaped history but also commit to building a future where every woman has the opportunity to lead, innovate, and inspire. 💜

💻 CodeTalk is transforming lives by providing low-income, underserved women with the digital skills and tools needed to launch successful careers in tech.

🌟We're thrilled to witness the hard work, dedication, and growth of these women who are now stepping into a brighter future. It's inspiring to see how the CodeTalk program doesn’t just teach skills—it changes lives by fostering a growth mindset, innovative teaching, and a powerful belief that we are not limited by our circumstances!

💜 Proud to partner with CodeTalk (thank you - Sharon Plunkett & Dr. Ryan J. Smith, EdD) and continue supporting their mission to empower underserved communities. Here's to a future full of opportunity for these talented women and youth!

"Dear community, the devastating fires in Los Angeles have shaken us all. 

Each day, we learn of families and businesses facing unimaginable challenges—evacuating on short notice, leaving behind homes, memories, and livelihoods.

We want you to know you’re not alone. We stand beside those impacted, offering support in any way we can. 

To those who are safe, we encourage you to join us in extending care and compassion to those in need.

In these trying times, we are reminded of the power of community and the strength we draw from one another. 

Together, we will rebuild, recover, and heal.💜",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7285139877598244864,Organic,,Talia Standring,01/15/2025,,,All followers,923,,,11,0.01191766001,31,0,5,,0.05092091113,
