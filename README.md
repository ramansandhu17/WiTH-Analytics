# Women in Technology Hollywood - Social Media Analytics (Q1 2025)

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing social media performance for **Women in Technology Hollywood (WiTH)** during **Q1 2025**. 
The dashboard visualizes impressions, clicks, engagement rate, and click-through rate (CTR), and identifies top-performing posts based on engagement.

## Dashboard Highlights
- **KPIs**: Total Impressions, Total Clicks, Avg. Engagement Rate, and Avg. CTR
- **Post-Level Metrics**: Engagement rate, likes, reposts, and performance ranking
- **Time-Based Trends**: Click and impression trends over Q1

## Data Cleaning & EDA
Data was cleaned and prepared using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to:
- Remove nulls and standardize date formats
- Calculate engagement metrics
- Identify trends and anomalies across posts
- Generate insights to guide visualization decisions

You can find the Jupyter notebooks for EDA in the `notebooks/` folder.
